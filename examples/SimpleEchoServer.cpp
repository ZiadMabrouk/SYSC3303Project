// SimpleEchoServer.java
// This class is the server side of a simple echo server based on
// UDP/IP. The server receives from a client a packet containing a character
// string, then echoes the string back to the client.

	//         that was received from the client.
	//  receivePacket.getLength() - the length of the packet data.
	//    Since we are echoing the received packet, this is the length 
	//    of the received packet's data. 
	//    This value is <= data.length (the length of the byte array).
	//  receivePacket.getAddress() - the Internet address of the 
	//     destination host. Since we want to send a packet back to the 
	//     client, we extract the address of the machine where the
	//     client is running from the datagram that was sent to us by 
	//     the client.
	//  receivePacket.getPort() - the destination port number on the 
	//     destination host where the client is running. The client
	//     sends and receives datagrams through the same socket/port,
	//     so we extract the port that the client used to send us the
	//     datagram, and use that as the destination port for the echoed
	//     packet.
