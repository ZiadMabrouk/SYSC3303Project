# SYSC3303Project
Elevator Scheduler Project


Things to do for iteration 1:
"README.txt" (not this file and done by person writing main file)
Make a contributions file to inform which member did which task for the iteration 
UML class and sequence diagrams (one person can do both or two people can do one each)
Instructions for setting up and testing the C++ files using the test files 
C++ code files and executable files that need to be completed (one C++ file and header file per thread made)
Files to be done are elevator.cpp, floor.cpp, main.cpp, and scheduler.cpp (one per person since there are four of them)
Ziad: Scheduler.cpp, code organizer, and one test case 
Jinan: Elevator.cpp, UML class diagram, and one test case
Daniel: Floor.cpp, UML sequence diagram, and one test case
Sami: main.cpp, README, instructions, and one test case
